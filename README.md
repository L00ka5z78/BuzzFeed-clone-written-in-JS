# BuzzFeed-clone-written-in-JS

Buzzfeed clone written in JS.
Simple app, with basic functions. Written with help of tutorial (Code with Ania Kub√≥w). After that i tried to buil it up by myself, but unfortunately i had to
look for help several times. But it was nice lesson and i think i learnt a lot.

What was positive.
  1. Few large function, where i was able to understand how it works and understand connections between them.
  2. Final result is ok, but could be better.
  3. Some new array methods was in use and i could watch and learn how to use them.
  4. Nice to remind some CSS styling. Its never enough in my case.
  
What was negative.
  1. Code. I think the code is to big to have it in one file. Would be nice to split it in few files and export them. (stuff to work with).
  2. Functions. Also, could be smaller, but now i dont know how to do it. Would be nice to get some feedback.
  3. Display in browser. Few images and text are not where they suppose to be. (i think, its because of CSS styling === stuff to work with)
  4. OOP, objects in arrays, arrays in objects and blah blah blahh.... Sometimes i understand it clearly, but sometimes its a rocket science for me. (stuff to work with)
